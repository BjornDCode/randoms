                    You will be presented with 5 riddles. If you manage to solve them all you will receive a discount code for a pack of Randoms. Each riddle will be a series of candy pieces where you will have to figure out what the next piece is. You can do this by looking at the pattern of the previous pieces. But you have to be quick! You only have 60 seconds for each riddle. If you donâ€™t manage to solve them all, you can try again later.
